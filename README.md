# responsive-base
Responsive css elements. Also stick to top navbar with compact view.

Include css reset.

## Navbar ##
* Sticks to top.
* No JQuery required.
* Default and mobile view. Media query as 768px width.
* Logo/brand, single nested links, floats left/right.

Problems for now.
* Too many links push to second row. Have to manage them manually.
* If last link in float: right is nested, its dropdown will clip to outside of the viewport.

## Responsive grids ##
Tried to make this like bootstrap. Only did 1 - 4 grids

Grid widths are following.
1. 1
2. 1/2
3. 1/3, 2/3
4. 1/4, 2/4, 3/4
